This does the\\nfollowing:\\n* Fixes @Provides injection so that parameters are checked for nullability.\\nBy default this will error.  The flag is named:\\nguice_check_nullable_provides_params and can be set to ERROR, WARNING or IGNORE.\\n* Adds InjectionPoint.forMethod to build an InjectionPoint off an arbitrary\\nmethod.\\n* Adds Binder.getProvider(Dependency) to a get a Provider for a given\\ndependency (with all its nullability & injection points maintained).\\n* Update ProviderLookup to accept a Dependency in addition to a Key.\\n\\nThis is in preparation for two things:\\n1) Allowing multibindings/mapbindings/optionalbindings to be specified as\\nannotations on methods in a module.\\n2) Adding a dagger compatibility module.\\n... the general idea will be that I'll also add a hook into\\nProvidesMethodModule somehow to look at arbitrary other annotations and let\\nfolks process them specially.\\n-------------\\nCreated by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java\\nMOE_MIGRATED_REVID=85353820\\n\n",
      "1263    This change is big, and it makes Guice slower. I'll need to follow-up with some optimizations that make TypeResolver quicker.\\n\\nSuppose you have a parameterized class:\\n\\nclass Foo<T> {\\n  @Inject Set<T> tees;\\n} \\n\\nThis change makes it so that as long as you have the required dependencies, parameterized injection points will be resolved. For example:\\n  Injector injector = Guice.createInjector(new AbstractModule() {\\n    protected void configure() {\\n      bind(new TypeLiteral<Set<String>>() {})\\n          .toInstance(ImmutableSet.of(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"));\\n      }\\n  });\\n  Foo<String> foo = injector.getInstance(new TypeLiteral<Foo<String>>() {});\\n  assertEquals(ImmutableSet.of(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"), foo.tees);\\n\\nThis builds on my earlier work for TypeResolver. That class is currently pretty slow (it builds a ton of HashMaps eagerly), but it shouldn't be too hard to make it lazy - that way everything will work nice and fast if you're not leveraging this feature.\\n\\ngit-svn-id: https://google-guice.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@660 d779f126-a31b-0410-b53b-1d3aecad763e\\n\n",
